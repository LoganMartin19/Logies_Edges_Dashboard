      <h2>About Logie’s Edges ⚡</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Logie’s Edges</strong> is a modern value betting and analytics platform built to
        uncover profitable opportunities that the market often misses. It combines live odds,
        statistical models, and AI analysis to estimate the <em>true</em> probabilities behind each
        outcome — helping you identify bets with a long-term mathematical advantage.

      <h3 style={{ marginTop: "24px" }}>👋 The Creator</h3>
      <p>
        Hi, I’m <strong>Logie</strong> — a Software Engineering graduate from the
        University of Glasgow and the developer behind Logie’s Edges. My background is in systems
        engineering and data-driven product design, and I’ve spent years building tools that bring
        clarity to complex data. Combining that with a lifelong love of football, the NFL, and
        sports analytics naturally led to this project.
      </p>

      <h3 style={{ marginTop: "24px" }}>📈 What is an “Edge”?</h3>
      <p>
        In betting, an <strong>edge</strong> means having a higher probability of winning than the
        bookmaker’s odds imply. If our model believes a team has a 55% chance of winning but the
        bookmaker’s price suggests only 45%, that difference is your <em>edge</em>. Over time,
        consistently betting when you have positive edges leads to profit — not luck.
      </p>
      <p>
        Logie’s Edges calculates this by converting both model probabilities and bookmaker odds
        into implied percentages, then highlighting where the market underestimates a team or
        outcome. It’s not about guessing — it’s about finding inefficiencies.
      </p>
